<b>🧚 Welcome to Fairy vs Villain!</b>

<b>🎲 How to Play:</b>
- Players join the game lobby using <code>/join</code>.
- When minimum 4 players have joined, roles are assigned randomly:
  Fairies, Villains, and Commoners.
- Fairies must identify and eliminate Villains.
- Villains try to secretly eliminate Fairies and Commoners.
- Commoners support Fairies by voting wisely.
- Use your unique powers wisely with <code>/usepower</code>.
- Vote to eliminate suspicious players with <code>/vote @username</code>.
- Earn XP and coins by playing, using powers, and winning rounds.
- Upgrade your powers using coins with <code>/upgrade</code> to gain advantage.

<b>📜 Commands:</b>
/startgame — Create a new game lobby in this group  
/join — Join the current game lobby  
/leave — Leave the lobby before game starts  
/end — End the current game  
/usepower — Use your secret special power  
/vote — Vote to eliminate a player (example: /vote @username)  
/upgrade — Upgrade your powers using XP and coins  
/shop — View and buy items with coins  
/myxp — Check your XP and coin balance  
/profile — View your role, stats, and power info  
/stats — See current game status and alive players  
/leaderboard — View global top players  
/myleaderboard — View this group's top players  
/help — Show this help message

<b>📖 Rules:</b>
- Minimum 4 players, maximum 15 per game.  
- Fairies win by eliminating all Villains.  
- Villains win by outnumbering Fairies.  
- Commoners help Fairies by voting carefully.  
- Use powers carefully; some have cooldowns or limits.  
- Voting majority eliminates a player each round.  
- Dead players cannot vote or use powers.

<b>💡 Tips:</b>
- Always communicate and watch for suspicious behavior.  
- Use <code>/usepower</code> privately to turn the tide.  
- Save coins and XP to upgrade powers and items.  
- Stay active and strategize with your team.

Good luck, have fun, and may the best team win! 🧚‍♀️👹
